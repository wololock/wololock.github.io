I enjoy learning new things and getting better in stuff I already know. Someone could call it a pursuit of mastering programming skills. I have heard a few years back that if you want to learn something precisely, you have to know how to explain it to others.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> There is this very popular quote attributed to Albert Einstein<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup>:</p></div><div class="quoteblock"><blockquote><div class="paragraph"><p><em>If you can&#8217;t explain it simply, you don&#8217;t understand it well enough.</em></p></div></blockquote></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Even though Einstein unlikely said that, it still sounds smart enough to give this quote a try and apply it in the real life.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>So I have decided I will be watching a few tags<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup> on Stack Overflow and I will try answering questions to solve people&#8217;s programming problems. I wanted to achieve this by providing clear and detailed explanation of a solution (and problem as well). I&#8217;ve focused on stuff I knew something about - things I wanted to explore deeper to get a better understanding about how things work.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="starting-point">Starting point</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>My Stack Overflow account exists since March 2013 and between 2013 and 2017 I was not very active user.

Here are my thoughts about the things I have learned from this journey.</p></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="1-i-dont-have-to-chase-the-rabbit">1. I don&#8217;t have to chase the rabbit</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>Many people say that getting involved in SO community these days does not make much sense, because all popular and interesting questions were already asked and it is almost impossible to earn high reputation based on questions that show up nowadays. If your goal is to chase people like Jon Skeet or even anyone who reached 100k reputation - you&#8217;re in trouble. Many highly reputable users gained their reputation with a snowball effect - they have delivered valuable answers to popular questions a few years back and they are constantly rewarded for that. I have heard that this is a&nbsp;blocker for many newcomers. I have no problem with that, because I have realized that <strong>I don&#8217;t have to compete with anyone</strong>. I focus on delivering valuable answers instead. And I won&#8217;t lie to you - I love being rewarded with reputation points or badges, but I have accepted the fact that this is only a side-effect of doing a good job, not an end in itself.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="2-there-are-many-people-waiting-for-my-help">2. There are many people waiting for my help</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>I guess you have heard about impostor syndrome.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup> I&#8217;ve found it pretty hard to overcome, especially if you are competitive by the nature and you constantly compare yourself to people that are more experienced and skilled than you, just like I did. Stack Overflow helped me hold my horses and look in the opposite direction. It became clear to me that I can learn more effectively <strong>if I help other people</strong> reaching my current level of experience. Sharing the knowledge, digging deeper in the areas I&#8217;m already familiar with and explaining these ideas with the simplest possible words boosted my learning process. And to give you a concrete example - I work with Groovy<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup> for more than 6 years already and I always saw myself as a experienced Groovy developer who knows pretty much about how things work behind the scenes. Thanks to Stack Overflow and tons of questions about different things in Groovy I have learned even more - each time I saw a question that required some sort of research from my side I jumped into it and explore it deeply enough to fully understand what&#8217;s going on. A good example of win-win situation - I have helped solving an issue and I have learned something new or I just understand the idea better.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="3-there-is-nothing-bad-in-being-wrong">3. There is nothing bad in being wrong</h3><div class="paragraph"><p>It happened to me a few times to give a wrong or partially wrong answer to the question I&#8217;ve found interesting. The good thing about Stack Overflow community is that there are people who will kindly tell you that your answer is wrong and what you can do to fix or improve it. Of course, there are a few jerks out there who will try to prove you&#8217;re stupid - simply ignore them.</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><h3 id="4-small-actions-repeated-consistently-produce-great-results">4.

Would you like to learn more about Groovy programming language? Maybe you are looking for a book recommendation?
I can definitely recommend reading **"Groovy In Action, 2nd edition"** written by {dierk-twitter}[Dierk König], {paul-twitter}[Paul King], and
associates. This is a book **882 pages** long that explains Groovy in details. It starts with explaining basic concepts of the language,
datatypes, control structures and closures. It explains Groovy's dynamic programming features, run-time and compile-time
metaprogramming, AST transformations, and benefits from using Groovy as a statically compiled language.

It also covers things around the Groovy library - builders, GDK (Groovy Development Kit) enhancements, tools for
accessing the database, working with XML and JSON, as well as interacting with various Web Services types (REST-based APIs,
XML-RPC, or SOAP). And much, much more.

If you are looking for **a comprehensive guide** to the Groovy programming language and its rich ecosystem, this book is the right
choice for you. I keep this book close to my desk so I can grab it and find interesting part during my daily work.

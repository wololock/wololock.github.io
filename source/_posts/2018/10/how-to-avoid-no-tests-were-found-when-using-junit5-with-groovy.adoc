In this short blog post I would like to explain how to avoid popular mistake when you write your
first JUnit 5 test case in Groovy.

== The example

Let's start with the example. Here is our `build.gradle` file that adds JUnit 5 dependency:

.build.gradle
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'groovy'
    id 'idea'
}

repositories {
	jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    compile localGroovy()

    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.3.1'
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.3.1'
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
----

And here is our test class:

.src/test/groovy/UnitTest.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class UnitTest {

    @Test
    def shouldThrowAnException() {
        throw new RuntimeException()
    }
}
----

This test does nothing, but it's fine. We just want to execute this test.

== The problem

Let's see what happens when we try to run this test:

[source,bash]
----
% gradle test

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
----

Nothing happened. When we try to execute this test inside IntelliJ IDEA, we will see something like this:

[.img-responsive.img-thumbnail]
[link=/images/groovy-junit5-def-mistake.png]
image::/images/groovy-junit5-def-mistake.png[]

What's wrong?

== The solution

The problem we shown above is caused by a single `def` keyword we used in `shouldThrowAnException` prototype.
This is common mistake, made very often by people who have experience with Spock Framework (which tolerates `def` btw).

So, what is the problem with `def` keyword? Firstly, let's take a look at the decompiled class:

.Decompiled UnitTest.class file
[source,java]
----
//
// Source code recreated from a .class file by IntelliJ IDEA
// (powered by Fernflower decompiler)
//

import groovy.lang.GroovyObject;
import groovy.lang.MetaClass;
import org.codehaus.groovy.runtime.callsite.CallSite;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class UnitTest implements GroovyObject {
    public UnitTest() {
        CallSite[] var1 = $getCallSiteArray();
        super();
        MetaClass var2 = this.$getStaticMetaClass();
        this.metaClass = var2;
    }

    @Test
    public Object shouldThrowAnException() {
        CallSite[] var1 = $getCallSiteArray();
        throw (Throwable)var1[0].callConstructor(RuntimeException.class);
    }
}
----

As you can see Groovy's `def` keyword gets compiled to `Object` type in this case. OK, but what is wrong with that?
Well, JUnit 5 method resolver https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/blob/master/junit-jupiter-engine/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/engine/discovery/predicates/IsTestMethod.java[uses `IsTestMethod` predicate]
which requires that test method returns `void`. Otherwise method annotated with `@Test` does not get resolved.

If we only replace `def` with `void` keyword:

.Updated src/test/groovy/UnitTest.groovy
[source,groovy]
----
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test

class UnitTest {

    @Test
    void shouldThrowAnException() {
        throw new RuntimeException()
    }
}
----

the test will execute and fail as expected:

[source,bash]
----
% gradle test

> Task :test FAILED

UnitTest > shouldThrowAnException() FAILED
    java.lang.RuntimeException at UnitTest.groovy:7

1 test completed, 1 failed

FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':test'.
> There were failing tests. See the report at: file:///home/wololock/workspace/groovy-junit5/build/reports/tests/test/index.html

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

* Get more help at https://help.gradle.org

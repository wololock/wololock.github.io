This blog post is inspired by one of my recent Stack Overflow answers to following question: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46279525/grails-why-is-the-config-groovy-file-executed-during-compilation/46376893[Grails: why is the Config.groovy file executed during compilation?].
Here I'm going to show you step by step what makes `grails package` command executing `Config.groovy` script and how
I've managed to find the answer to that question.

== Grails 2.4 configuration files

According to following http://docs.grails.org/2.4.4/guide/conf.html#config[Grails 2.4 documentation]:

> For general configuration Grails provides two files:
>
>  * `grails-app/conf/BuildConfig.groovy`
>  * `grails-app/conf/Config.groovy`
>  
> Both of them use Groovy's http://docs.groovy-lang.org/2.4.6/html/gapi/groovy/util/ConfigSlurper.html[`ConfigSlurper`] syntax.
> The first, `BuildConfig.groovy`, is for settings that are used when running Grails commands, such as compile, doc, etc. 
> The second file, `Config.groovy`, is for settings that are used when your application is running. This means that 
> `Config.groovy` is packaged with your application, but `BuildConfig.groovy` is not. Don't worry if you're not clear 
> on the distinction: the guide will tell you which file to put a particular setting in. 

After reading such documentation you could run into assumption, that no matter what you put into `Config.groovy` file
it will get executed while running application only. Unfortunately - this is not true.

== Packaging Grails application

Let's investigate together what happens when we call `grails package` command. Every Grails command has a Groovy script 
associated. Those scripts are provided with Grails distribution. `package` command is represented by following Groovy script:

When you run `grails package` Grails executes target `packageApp` defined in line 38. In line 48 Grails uses 
https://github.com/grails/grails-core/blob/2.4.x/grails-project-api/src/main/groovy/org/codehaus/groovy/grails/project/packaging/GrailsProjectPackager.groovy#L251[`GrailsProjectPackager.packageApplication()`]
that does the packaging. Inside this method there is a call to a `createConfig()` private method that in line 345 delegates
parsing of a configuration file to a https://github.com/grails/grails-core/blob/2.4.x/grails-project-api/src/main/groovy/org/codehaus/groovy/grails/project/packaging/GrailsProjectPackager.groovy#L345[`ConfigSlurper.parse(configClass)`] method:

.https://github.com/grails/grails-core/blob/2.4.x/grails-project-api/src/main/groovy/org/codehaus/groovy/grails/project/packaging/GrailsProjectPackager.groovy#L345[org/codehaus/groovy/grails/project/packaging/GrailsProjectPackager.groovy]
[source,groovy]
----
config = configSlurper.parse(configClass)
----

`ConfigSlurper` does several things, but there is one line of code we are interested the most:

.https://github.com/groovy/groovy-core/blob/GROOVY_2_4_X/src/main/groovy/util/ConfigSlurper.groovy#L286[src/main/groovy/util/ConfigSlurper.groovy]
[source,groovy]
----
script.run()
----


This is our game changer. There is one thing worth mentioning here as well. `Config.groovy` is compiled to a Java class
that extends `groovy.lang.Script` class. Basically all Groovy scripts are represented that way in the bytecode - this class is 
simply a wrapper that provides `main` method that is executed by JVM. That's why `ConfigSlurper.parse(Script script, URL location)`
is used to parse `Config.groovy` file.

== Side effects

There is only one major side effect of this situation - expect that any business logic inside `Config.groovy` file will be executed.
This is not a problem in most cases, because this file is used mostly for a assigning values to a variables we can access with
`grailsApplication.config` reference. But if you put something like

[source,groovy]
----
println "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
----

in the end of `Config.groovy` file, expect to see something like this when you package your Grails application:
